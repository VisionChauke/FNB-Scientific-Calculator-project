# 🧮 Scientific Calculator

A fully functional **Scientific Calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This calculator can handle both basic and advanced mathematical operations including trigonometric functions, logarithmic calculations, square roots, exponents, and constants like π and e.


## 🔧 Features

- Basic Arithmetic: `+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`
- Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
- Logarithmic and root functions: `log`, `√`
- Power and exponential: `^`, `e`
- Constants: `π` and `e`
- Clear (`C`) and Delete (`DEL`) buttons
- Mobile-friendly and responsive design

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The calculator captures input using a text field.
- Functions like `Math.sin()`, `Math.log10()` and `Math.sqrt()` are triggered through JavaScript.
- Expressions are parsed and evaluated using the `eval()` function after sanitizing and replacing symbols (e.g., `√` to `Math.sqrt`).
